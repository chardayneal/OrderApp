OrderApp is a simple food ordering app used by restaurants to track customers order and receive estimated preparation time.

## Description

An iOS application that allows employees to navigate a restaurant’s menu with ease and add desired food items to customers’ orders. Employees can switch between tabs that display the menu and a list of items of the current order. Once an order is submitted, the employee is given a confirmation of the customer’s total price and estimated preparation time. This app utilizes information from a local server API and translates information into user friendly interfaces on their personal device
